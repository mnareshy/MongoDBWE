> Mongo offers pluggable storage engines.

> Storage engine is a intermediate layer between the persistent disk and the actual mongodb server itself!
  Mongodb server interacts with the persistent disk through storage engine. The structure of data, indexes and
  Memory optimization decides by the storage engine. Storage engine will have control on memory, it decides
  What to put in disk , what to put in memory and when to put in memory.
  
> MongoDB brings pluggable storage engines , type of storage engine brings different types of performance 
  characteristics to MongoDb.
  
> There are 2 default storage engines comes with the MongoDb bundle 
	1. MMAP(default if you don't specify anything)  2 . WILD TIGER
	
>  Storage engine doesn't impact the the communication between the nodes in the cluster nor the programmers API!
